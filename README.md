# Code Commenter

The rationale behind writing this plugin was to simplify the process of *intelligently* commenting code contained within code blocks, with the ability to adapt to different languages. I was unable to find a plugin (core or community) that could achieve this so I'm attempting it myself.

## To-do
- [ ] Implement block/multi-line commenting
